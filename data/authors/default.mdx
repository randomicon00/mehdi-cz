Hi, I'm Mehdi Akiki—a **software engineer** with a background in electrical engineering. I've been hooked on coding since my first C program in 1998.

I build full-stack apps using **Next.js**, **React** and **TypeScript** on the front-end and **Python**, **Go**, **Java**, and **Rust** on the back end. I thrive on solving tough problems and love diving into challenges, whether it's debugging UI quirks or optimizing cloud services.

I also give back by contributing to open-source projects like **Rust**, **Rust Analyzer**, **Deno**, and **Mozilla**.

I'm open to freelance and full-time opportunities.
Here’s my <a href="/static/files/mehdiakiki_resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.
