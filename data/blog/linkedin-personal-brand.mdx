LinkedIn is a searchable place—optimize your presence for discoverability and consistent signal.

### Quick profile checklist

- **Headline**: Role + one specialty (e.g., "Frontend Engineer — React, Performance")
- **About**: 3 short paragraphs: who you help, what you build, CTA
- **Experience**: bullets with impact metrics
- **Featured**: 3 projects/posts
- **Skills**: top 10 skills and endorsements

### Post template (easy to reuse)

```text
Hook: one-sentence insight or metric
What I did: 2 lines
Result: metric or short quote
Link: project/article/demo
```

### Engagement strategy

- Post two short technical updates per week (1–3 paragraphs)
- Comment on posts from hiring managers or companies you want to work with
- Repost case study snippets linking to the full article

Small, regular actions compound. Recruiters search for concise keywords—use them in the headline and About section.
