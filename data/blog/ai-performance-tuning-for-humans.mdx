Fast feels good. You don’t need dark magic—just a few steady steps and honest measurement.

## Start with the user

- Pick one slow page or action
- Measure load time and interaction time
- Write down a tiny goal (e.g., “-300ms on first paint”)

## Ask AI for ideas

- “List 3 small changes that reduce JS size or work on this page.”
- “Explain what blocks rendering here.”
- “Suggest one caching improvement and a safe way to test it.”

## Change, measure, commit

- Make one change
- Measure again with the same method
- If it helps, keep it; if not, revert

## Common wins

- Smaller images
- Less blocking JS/CSS
- Cache headers on static assets

## Pitfalls

- Big complex rewrites without data
- Optimizing what users don’t feel
- Mixing many changes in one PR

## Takeaways

- Small step, measure, decide
- AI suggests; you verify with numbers
- Focus on what users feel first
