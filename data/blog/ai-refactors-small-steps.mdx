Refactors don’t need to be scary. AI can suggest small improvements you can merge with confidence.

## What to refactor

- Long functions → small functions
- Confusing names → clear names
- Duplication → one clean helper

## A calm workflow

1. Ask for 2–3 small refactor ideas (no large rewrites)
2. Pick one, run tests
3. Commit, repeat next time

## Example prompts

- “Suggest tiny refactors for readability, keep diff under 30 lines.”
- “Rename variables to be clear and consistent.”
- “Extract one helper from this function.”

## Common pitfalls

- Huge PRs that are hard to review
- Changing behavior without tests
- Mixing refactor + feature changes

## Key takeaways

- Small steps win. Tests protect. You choose.
- AI gives options; you pick what to merge.
- Aim for clarity, not cleverness.
