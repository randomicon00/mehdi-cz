Transform debugging from trial-and-error to systematic problem-solving using AI to analyze errors and suggest solutions.

## Stack Trace Analysis

```python
import openai

def analyze_stack_trace(error, code_context):
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze this error and provide debugging guidance:

    Error:
    {error}

    Related code:
    {code_context}

    Provide:
    1. Root cause analysis
    2. Step-by-step debugging approach
    3. Potential fixes with code examples
    4. Prevention strategies
    """

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Usage
error_msg = """
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
    at UserList.render (UserList.jsx:15)
    at ReactCompositeComponent._renderValidatedComponent
"""

code = """
function UserList({ users }) {
    return (
        <div>
            {users.map(user => <UserCard key={user.id} user={user} />)}
        </div>
    );
}
"""

analysis = analyze_stack_trace(error_msg, code)
```

## Interactive Debug Assistant

```python
def debug_session():
    print("AI Debug Assistant - Describe your issue")

    while True:
        user_input = input("\n> ")
        if user_input.lower() in ['exit', 'quit']:
            break

        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a debugging expert. Help solve programming issues step by step."
            }, {
                "role": "user",
                "content": user_input
            }]
        )

        print(f"\nAI: {response.choices[0].message.content}")
```

**Pro tip:** Include environment details, recent changes, and expected vs actual behavior for better AI analysis.

## Why this matters

- Debugging is where time disappears; AI helps you form better hypotheses quickly.
- You get targeted repro steps and likely root causes instead of guesswork.
- It turns scattered logs into a coherent timeline you can act on.

## How to use this today

- Paste failing tests and stack traces; ask for the smallest repro script.
- Compare two commits and have AI explain what changed in behavior, not just code.
- Ask for “next 3 probes” to add (logs/metrics) before making fixes.

## Common pitfalls

- Chasing symptoms: insist on a clear causal chain from input to failure.
- Non-determinism: capture environment details and seed values every time.
- Overfitting the fix: write a failing test first and keep the patch minimal.

## What to try next

- Teach the bot your logging conventions and error taxonomies.
- Auto-open an issue with repro, scope, and rollback plan when CI fails.
- Generate a postmortem template from the incident timeline.
