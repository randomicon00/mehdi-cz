Good docs feel like a teammate helping you. AI can speed up, but keep the voice human and warm.

## A simple structure

- What is this?
- When to use it (and when not)
- How to start (3 steps)
- Examples (1–2 short ones)
- Common mistakes

## Prompts that work

- “Turn these notes into a short, friendly README with the structure above.”
- “Simplify this section for a non-native reader. Use short sentences.”
- “Suggest a tiny example that shows the happy path.”

## Tone tips

- Prefer simple words
- Active voice
- Talk to the reader: “you can”, “let’s”

## Common pitfalls

- Wall of text
- Copying internal jargon to users
- Out-of-date docs floating around

## Key takeaways

- Docs are for people. AI helps, you edit.
- Keep it short and honest. Explain trade-offs.
- Update docs when behavior changes. Always.
