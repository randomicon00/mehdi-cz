summary: "A fast, repeatable proposal template to win freelance clients without over-engineering."
---

Proposals win when they remove ambiguity and make the next step obvious.

### One-paragraph proposal template

```text
Summary: 1 sentence — what I will deliver and the expected outcome.
Scope: Deliverables, timeline (weeks), assumptions.
Cost: $X (or milestones).
Risks: top 2 risks and mitigations.
Next steps: how to accept and availability.
```

### What signals trust

- Add a 2–3 line relevant case study with a metric
- Offer a low-cost Phase 1 to validate technical risk
- Use plain language: clients prefer clarity over cleverness

### Example (quick)

```text
Summary: Build a responsive checkout page to reduce cart abandonment by 10–15%.
Scope: UI improvements, performance optimizations, QA — 4 weeks.
Cost: $8,000 (50% upfront, 50% on delivery).
Risks: Third-party payment provider integration — mitigate with simulated testing.
Next steps: Sign attached SOW and initial deposit to start.
```

Maintain a living template and reuse the first 2 paragraphs to win speed without losing quality.
