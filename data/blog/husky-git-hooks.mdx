Today I learned about **Husky** and its role in managing Git hooks. I had seen a husky folder in my project but hadn’t fully understood its purpose until now. Husky helps automate tasks like linting or running tests before committing code, making sure your codebase stays clean without you needing to remember to do it manually.

The typical folder structure looks something like this:

```text
project/
│
├── .husky/
│   ├── pre-commit
│   └── post-commit
│
└── package.json
```

In my project, I found a script like this:

```bash
npx --no-install lint-staged
```

This command tells Husky to run `lint-staged` before a commit. It’s really helpful because it ensures that
only the staged files are linted, making my commit process smoother and error-free.
