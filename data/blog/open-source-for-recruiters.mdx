summary: "How contributing to open source can surface you to recruiters and how to do it efficiently."

Open source contributions are social proof: they show collaboration, code quality, and initiative. Recruiters value sustained, meaningful activity.

### High-impact contribution types

- **Bug fixes** with tests and clear PR descriptions
- **Documentation & examples** that reduce onboarding friction
- **Small features or plugins** that fill gaps
- **Integrations/adapters** for popular ecosystems

### Visibility fast wins

- Use clear PR titles and link to your profile or case study
- Write a short blog post explaining the change and why it matters
- Pin meaningful PRs or projects in your profile README

### Timebox strategy

- Spend 1–2 focused hours/week: triage, small PR, docs
- Filter repos by labels: `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `docs`

Recruiters look for consistent contribution and collaborative behaviour — quality over quantity.
