summary: Learn how to apply your Prettier configuration across all files in your project with a single command, avoiding the need for manual file saving in Neovim.
---

To apply your `Prettier` changes across all files in your project, you can use the following command from your project’s root directory. This will reformat all files in the project based on your `Prettier` configuration:

1. Open your terminal in the root of your project.

2. Run the following command:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

This command will:

- **Locate all files** in the project (starting from the current directory).

- **Reformat all files** according to your Prettier settings (from .prettierrc or similar configuration files).

## Optional: Limiting to Specific File Types

If you want to format only certain file types, for example, only JavaScript and TypeScript files, you can specify the file types:

```bash
npx prettier --write "**/*.{js,ts}"
```

This way, you avoid the need to manually open and save each file in Neovim.
