summary: "Automate safe, reversible fixes and let AI suggest next steps with context."

Close the loop on incidents with scripted, auditable remediation and human-in-the-loop AI.

## Minimal job (pseudo)

```yaml
# runbooks/restart-service.yml
description: Restart service with health checks
steps:
  - run: kubectl rollout restart deploy/api
  - run: kubectl rollout status deploy/api --timeout=5m
  - verify: curl -f https://api.example.com/health
```

## AI next-action

```bash
# scripts/ai-next-action.sh
gather_context | llm --prompt "Given logs and SLOs, suggest next safe step"
```

## Why this matters

- Reduce MTTR while keeping safety and traceability.
- Capture tribal knowledge as code.

## How to use this today

- Start with read-only diagnostics, then add low-risk actions.
- Require approvals for destructive steps.
- Record every execution with inputs/outputs.

## Common pitfalls

- Hidden side effects; always add pre/post checks.
- No rollback; define clear revert steps per action.
- Sprawl; curate a small catalog of high-value runbooks.

## What to try next

- Use SLO-based triggers to propose runbooks automatically.
- Attach ownership and cost to each run.
- Add simulators to test runbooks in sandboxes regularly.
