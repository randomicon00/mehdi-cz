To quickly look up English word definitions from your terminal, you can use a command line dictionary like sdcv (StarDict Command Line Version). Here’s how to install it:

## Installation

**For Debian/Ubuntu**:

```bash
sudo apt install sdcv
```

**For Fedora**:

```bash
sudo dnf install sdcv
```

**For Arch Linux**:

```bash
sudo pacman -S sdcv
```

## Usage

After installing, you can look up words like this:

```bash
sdcv [word]
```

To add dictionaries, you can download dictionary files (such as StarDict dictionaries) and place them in the `~/.stardict/dic/` directory.
