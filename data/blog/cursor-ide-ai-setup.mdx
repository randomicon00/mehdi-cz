Cursor IDE is built for AI-first development. Learn to leverage its unique features for faster, smarter coding.

## Key Features Setup

**Composer (Ctrl+I):** Multi-file AI editing

```
Enable in settings: AI > Composer > Auto-apply simple changes
```

**Chat (Ctrl+L):** Contextual code discussions

```
@workspace - Include entire codebase context
@file - Reference specific files
@code - Discuss selected code
```

**Tab Autocomplete:** Intelligent code completion

```
Settings > AI > Tab Autocomplete > Enable
Model: GPT-4 (for better accuracy)
```

## Effective Workflows

**Refactoring:**

```
1. Select code block
2. Ctrl+I: "Extract this to a reusable hook"
3. Review and apply changes
```

**Bug fixing:**

```
1. Ctrl+L with error context
2. Ask: "This function throws [error]. Fix it and explain why"
```

**Code review:**

```
1. Select function/class
2. Ctrl+L: "Review this code for performance and security issues"
```

## Pro Tips

- Use Rules for Custom Instructions to maintain coding standards
- Configure model preferences per project type
- Leverage the command palette for quick AI actions

## Why this matters

- Good editor ergonomics make AI assistance feel native, not noisy.
- You reduce context switching and keep momentum during tough tasks.
- A tuned setup improves code quality without extra ceremony.

## How to use this today

- Start with minimal keybindings; add only what you use weekly.
- Configure project-level context (docs, scripts, scripts) for better recall.
- Enable inline explanations and diffs when reviewing changes.

## Common pitfalls

- Feature overload: disable what you don’t actively use.
- Leaky context: avoid sending secrets or large proprietary blobs.
- Drift: share a team settings file to standardize experience.

## What to try next

- Add commands that generate tests/docs with one keystroke.
- Automate playgrounds for quick repros inside the editor.
- Create a prompt palette tailored to your stack.
