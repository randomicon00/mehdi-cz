Today, I learned something simple but powerful: how to format every Rust file in a project efficiently with one command.
Rust’s `cargo fmt` tool does the heavy lifting, applying consistent code style across the entire project.

To format all files in your project, run:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

That’s it. This command formats all `.rs` files, ensuring your code follows the community's conventions. No need to worry
about inconsistent indentation or spacing.

Additionally, if you're like me and want to ensure everything is automatically formatted before committing code, you can
add a pre-commit hook or run this as part of your CI pipeline.
