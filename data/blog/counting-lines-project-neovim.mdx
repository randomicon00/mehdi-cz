Today, I wanted to get a quick count of lines of code (LOC) in a large project I’m working on. If you’re using Neovim like I am, there's a straightforward way to do this without leaving the editor. The trick combines the find and wc (word count) commands, run directly from Neovim.

Here’s how:

### The Command

```bash
find . -name '*.ext' -type f | xargs wc -l
```

#### Explanation:

- `find . -name '*.ext' -type f`: This part of the command recursively searches through the current directory (`.`) for files that match a specific extension, like `*.js` for JavaScript files. Replace `*.ext` with the file extension of your choice. If you want to include all files, use ``*`.

- `xargs wc -l`: The `xargs` command takes the output from `find` and applies the `wc -l` command to each file. `wc -l` counts the number of lines in each file and then provides a total.

### Running in Neovim

To run this directly in Neovim, open the command mode by typing : and add an exclamation mark ! to run shell commands:

```bash
:!find . -name '*.ext' -type f | xargs wc -l
```

This outputs the line count directly in Neovim, keeping everything in one place.
