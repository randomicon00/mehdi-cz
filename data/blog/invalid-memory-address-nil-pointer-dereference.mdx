summary: A concise guide to understanding and resolving the 'invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference' error in Go, covering common causes and practical solutions.
---

The `invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` error in Go signals an attempt to access uninitialized (`nil`) memory, often resulting in a segmentation fault. This typically occurs when using pointers, structs, or interfaces that haven’t been properly initialized.

### Common Causes

1. **Uninitialized Pointers**: Using a pointer to a struct without memory allocation.
2. **Nil Interfaces**: Passing a `nil` interface or method on an uninitialized interface.
3. **Uninitialized Dependencies**: Missing initialization for dependencies like database clients.

### Example

n this example, accessing `db.Connection` causes an error because db is `nil`:

```go
type Database struct { Connection string }

func main() {
    var db *Database // db is nil
    fmt.Println(db.Connection) // causes nil pointer dereference
}
```

### Solutions

- Check for `nil` before accessing a pointer:

```go
if db != nil { fmt.Println(db.Connection) }
```

- **Proper Initialization**: Use `&Database{}` or `new(Database)` to ensure memory is allocated.

Following these practices reduces the likelihood of encountering `nil` pointer errors in Go, keeping your code more stable and predictable.
