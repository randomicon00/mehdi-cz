Updates pile up fast. Automate them and use AI to focus on the safest, highest ROI changes.

## Minimal Renovate config

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": ["config:recommended"],
  "timezone": "UTC",
  "prHourlyLimit": 2,
  "schedule": ["after 18:00 on Friday"],
  "dependencyDashboard": true,
  "packageRules": [
    { "matchDepTypes": ["devDependencies"], "groupName": "dev deps (safe)" },
    { "matchUpdateTypes": ["minor", "patch"], "groupName": "safe updates" }
  ]
}
```

## AI hinting (pseudo)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/renovate-ai-review.yml
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  summarize:
    if: contains(github.head_ref, 'renovate/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Summarize risk
        run: node scripts/ai-summarize-renovate-pr.mjs
```

## Why this matters

- Reduces security and supply-chain risk.
- Avoids big-bang upgrades by shipping small changes continuously.

## How to use this today

- Enable Renovate with recommended config and a weekly batch window.
- Auto-merge patch/minor for dev deps; require review for majors and runtime.
- Generate AI summaries to speed reviewer understanding.

## Common pitfalls

- Too many PRs; use grouping and schedules.
- Flaky tests blocking merges; stabilize critical paths first.
- Lockfile churn; pin where necessary and cache properly in CI.

## What to try next

- Add scorecards for security fixes and prioritize.
- Run canaries for runtime deps before broad rollout.
- Use SBOMs to audit transitive changes post-merge.
