When working with JavaScript objects, there are times when you need to use a variable as a key, rather than a fixed string. This is where "computed property names" come into play, using square brackets to dynamically assign object keys.

Here’s an example:

```js
const inputKey = "name";
const value = "John";

// Without brackets
const obj = {
  inputKey: value, // The key is literally "inputKey"
};

// With brackets
const obj = {
  [inputKey]: value, // The key is "name" (value of inputKey)
};
```

In the first case, the object will have a key `"inputKey"`. In the second, the key will be whatever value `inputKey` holds — in this case, `"name"`.

This technique is super useful when building objects dynamically, especially in cases like updating state in React:

```js
setInputValues((prevState) => ({
  ...prevState,
  [inputKey]: value, // Dynamically setting the key
}));
```

By using `[inputKey]`, we ensure that the actual value of `inputKey` is used as the property name, giving us flexibility in constructing objects based on variables.

This small trick is a powerful tool to make your code more dynamic and flexible!
