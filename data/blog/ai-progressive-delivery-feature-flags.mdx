Combine feature flags with AI risk models for safer, faster rollouts.

## Risk-aware rollout (pseudo)

```yaml
# feature-flags.yml
flags:
  new_checkout:
    segments:
      - name: canary
        percentage: 1
      - name: low_risk_users
        query: risk_score < 0.2
      - name: general
        percentage: 25
observability:
  metrics: [p95_latency, error_rate, conversion]
  ai_guard: { halt_threshold: medium, explain: true }
```

## Why this matters

- Avoids big-bang surprises; catches issues in small rings first.
- Uses real signals to adapt rollout velocity.

## How to use this today

- Start with LaunchDarkly/Unleash/Flagsmith + OpenTelemetry.
- Define halt thresholds tied to SLOs and business KPIs.

## Common pitfalls

- Too many flags with no cleanup; add TTLs and owners.
- Blind to cohort bias; diversify and randomize where needed.

## What to try next

- Use causal analysis on experiments to avoid false positives.
- Feed AI guard with business outcomes, not just tech metrics.
