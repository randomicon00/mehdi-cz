Good comms reduce stress and duplicate work during incidents.

## Template + AI drafting

```md
Impact: <who/what>
Timeline: <when>
Mitigation: <what we did>
Next: <what remains>
```

```bash
collect_context | llm --prompt "Fill the template succinctly for execs and users"
```

## Why this matters

- Keeps everyone aligned and reduces noise pings.
- Lets engineers focus on mitigation.

## How to use this today

- Adopt a standard template and cadence (e.g., 30/60/120 min updates).
- Auto-publish drafts to a review channel for quick edits.
- Store final notes for postmortems.

## Common pitfalls

- Over-promising ETAs; state uncertainty clearly.
- Jargon-heavy updates; write for non-engineers.
- Forgetting to close the loop; send a final resolution note.

## What to try next

- Tailor updates by audience (customers vs execs) via prompt variables.
- Generate internal FAQs during longer incidents.
- Use AI to extract action items and owners afterward.
