### The Purpose of the `never` Type in TypeScript

In TypeScript, the `never` type represents values that **never occur**. It is typically used when a function never returns (e.g., infinite loops or exceptions), or when the type system determines certain branches of code are unreachable.

#### Example 1: Assigning `never`

Variables of type `never` cannot hold any other type of value, not even `null` or `undefined`.

```typescript
let variable: void = null;
let variable1: never = null; // error: Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'never'
let variable2: never = 1; // error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'never'
let variable3: never = "geek"; // error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'never'
let variable4: never = true; // error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'never'
```

#### Example 2: Infinite Loops and Unreachable Code

Functions that are guaranteed to never complete can have a return type of `never`. This includes infinite loops or functions that always throw errors.

```ts
function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {} // This function never stops executing
}

function greet(): never {
  while (true) {
    console.log("hello");
  }
}
```

These functions never have an endpoint, so their return type is `never`.

#### Example 3: Throwing Exceptions

If a function always throws an error and never returns a value, its return type should be `never`.

```ts
function throwTypeError(message: string): never {
  throw new TypeError(message); // This function never returns
}

function func(): never {
  return throwTypeError("An error occurred"); // The return type is `never` since it throws an error
}
```

Here, both `throwTypeError` and `func` are of type `never` because they throw errors and never return.

### When to Use never

1. **Unreachable Code**: Use `never` when you’re sure certain code paths are impossible. For example, in exhaustive type checking or guards, the type may narrow to `never` if all possibilities are ruled out. 2.**Error Handling**: Functions that only throw exceptions and `never` return a value should be marked as `never`.
2. **Infinite Loops**: Functions that run infinitely without returning, such as servers or loops, should have a `never` return type.

In short, `never` signifies that something never happens—no value, no return, no completion. It’s a powerful tool to increase the robustness of your code and ensure clarity for unreachable paths or intentional non-returning functions.
