summary: "Use AI inside your normal frontend workflow: components, styles, small fixes."

Frontend work is creative. AI should help, not interrupt.

## Good use cases

- Generate small component scaffolds
- Suggest accessible labels and alt text
- Explain a tricky CSS layout

## Simple prompts

- “Create a basic Button with loading and disabled states. Keep it small.”
- “Make this form label accessible. Explain why.”
- “Why is this element overflowing? Suggest a minimal fix.”

## Keep your taste

- Use your design tokens
- Prefer simple CSS before new libraries
- Review code style before merging

## Pitfalls

- Auto-generating big UI kits you won’t maintain
- Accepting magic CSS with no explanation
- Ignoring performance of third-party UI

## Takeaways

- Use AI as a helper, not a designer
- Small pieces fit better and last longer
- Accessibility first wins trust
