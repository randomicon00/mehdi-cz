Technical blog posts are one of the best ways to attract targeted visitors — engineers, hiring managers, and potential clients — when they answer niche, search-driven questions.

### Quick checklist (write + publish)

- Pick long-tail keywords: e.g., "Next.js image optimization 2025"
- Put the keyword in title, H1, and meta description early
- Use clear H2/H3 headings and short paragraphs for skimmability
- Add runnable code blocks and a small example repo
- Include internal links to relevant projects and case studies

### Promotion shortcuts

- Share a focused excerpt on LinkedIn with the key metric
- Post code snippets on GitHub Gists and link back
- Submit high-signal posts to relevant communities (Dev.to, Reddit r/reactjs, Hacker News)

### Measure & iterate

- Use Google Search Console: watch queries and impressions
- Improve titles for pages with clicks but low CTR
- Refresh underperforming posts with new code or updated results

Consistency matters: one high-quality technical post every 1–2 weeks will compound into steady organic traffic over months.
