Rust 1.80 continues to build on the language’s reputation for performance, safety, and developer experience. Here are the three standout features introduced in this version:

## 1. Stabilized MaybeUninit::uninit_array API

The new `MaybeUninit::uninit_array()` function allows developers to create uninitialized arrays safely.
This is useful for performance-sensitive code that needs to avoid unnecessary initialization of data, such as in scenarios involving complex memory management. This API helps ensure safety while providing flexibility in managing uninitialized
memory.

```rust
let mut arr: [MaybeUninit<i32>; 10] = MaybeUninit::uninit_array();
```

## 2. `let` Chains in `if` and `while` Conditions

Rust 1.80 stabilizes a syntactic improvement called _let chains_, allowing you to combine multiple `let` conditions in `if` and `while` statements. This feature improves readability and allows more expressive conditional statements in your code.

```rust
if let Some(x) = option && let Some(y) = other_option {
    // Use both x and y here
}
```

This feature helps in writing concise conditional logic without needing nested blocks.

## 3. Faster Compilation with Crate Inlining

Rust 1.80 includes improvements to crate inlining during the build process. When enabled, this feature speeds up compilation times by more aggressively inlining crates that have been previously compiled, reducing the overhead in re-compiling dependencies. This leads to faster iteration times, especially in large projects.
