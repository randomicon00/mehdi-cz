Planning is easier when the document is short and clear.

## What to ask AI

- “Turn these notes into a one-page plan: goals, non-goals, risks, milestones.”
- “List unclear parts I should confirm with the team.”
- “Suggest a tiny MVP we can ship in 1–2 weeks.”

## Keep it human

- Agree on words and examples
- Share early drafts, invite comments
- Update the plan when reality changes

## Pitfalls

- Fancy templates nobody reads
- Too much detail, no decisions
- No owner for the plan

## Takeaways

- Plans are for people, not tools
- AI helps you write fast; your team makes it real
- Simple scope wins, shipped product teaches
