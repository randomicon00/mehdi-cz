Production ML breaks quietly. Use AI-assisted monitoring to catch issues early and act safely.

## Minimal drift check with Evidently

```python
# pip install evidently
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metrics import DataDriftPreset

ref_df = load_dataframe("/data/train.parquet")
prod_df = load_dataframe("/data/predictions_window.parquet")

report = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset()])
report.run(reference_data=ref_df, current_data=prod_df)
summary = report.as_dict()

if summary["metrics"][0]["result"]["dataset_drift"]:
    print("Drift detected: opening incident & flagging model for review…")
```

## Auto-retrain guardrail (pseudo)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/model-watch.yml
on:
  schedule: [{ cron: "*/15 * * * *" }]
jobs:
  drift-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run drift report
        run: python scripts/drift_check.py --window 24h --threshold 0.1
      - name: Open issue on drift
        if: failure()
        uses: actions-ecosystem/action-create-issue@v1
        with:
          title: "Drift detected: investigate and decide retrain"
```

## Why this matters

- Drift quietly degrades accuracy and user trust.
- Lightweight monitoring prevents silent failures.

## How to use this today

- Start with Evidently or NannyML for drift/quality checks.
- Log model inputs/outputs with IDs to enable slice-level analysis.
- Create a weekly dashboard plus 15-min drift checks.

## Common pitfalls

- No ground-truth feedback loop; add delayed labels where possible.
- Overreacting to noise; set slice-aware, stable thresholds.
- Auto-redeploy without approvals; require human sign-off for prod.

## What to try next

- Add canary scoring on a shadow model before swaps.
- Store all reports (S3/GCS) for audits and trend lines.
- Tie alerts to rollback/playbooks in your on-call rota.
