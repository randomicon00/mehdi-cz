# Rust Async's Main Libraries

Rust, unlike Go, does not have a built-in asynchronous runtime like
goroutines. Instead, asynchronous programming in Rust relies on external
libraries, offering developers more flexibility but requiring some
setup.

1. **tokio**: The most popular async runtime in Rust, widely used for
   high-performance network applications. It provides a multithreaded
   scheduler, async I/O, timers, and more. Its ecosystem includes utilities
   like `tokio::fs` and `tokio::net`, making it ideal for web services.

2. **async-std**: Modeled after Rust's standard library, this runtime
   offers familiar abstractions like `File`, `TcpStream`, and `Mutex` in an async
   context. It's known for ease of use and compatibility with existing
   code.

3. **smol**: A lightweight, minimal runtime with a focus on simplicity.
   Smol is perfect for smaller projects where performance isn't the
   primary concern.

These libraries allow developers to write non-blocking code in Rust,
offering various levels of abstraction and performance depending on
project needs.
