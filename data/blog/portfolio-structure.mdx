You have under 10 seconds to make a good first impression. Your portfolio should answer: Who are you? What can you do? How do I contact you?

### Minimal page map

- **Hero**: one-line value prop + CTA (Hire / Projects)
- **Featured projects**: 3–5 with case studies and metrics
- **About**: short bio, skills, resume link
- **Blog**: technical posts and case studies (internal links)
- **Contact**: email, Calendly, LinkedIn

### Project checklist (for each featured project)

- One-sentence summary
- Your role (concise)
- Tech stack (icons help)
- Impact (metric → timeframe)
- Demo / repo link

### SEO & recruiter-focused tweaks

- Title format: `"Firstname Lastname — Role | Specialty"` (appears in search)
- Use JSON-LD for `Person` and `Project` (structured data)
- Optimize images (descriptive alt text, compressed)
- Add `rel="canonical"` and sitemaps for search engines

### Resume and contact

- Provide a single PDF resume link labeled "One-page resume"
- Add a short line: "Open to remote freelance and full-time roles"
- Include preferred contact methods and timezone

### Accessibility and performance

- Fast load times help SEO and recruiter patience
- Ensure headings are semantic (H1, H2) so search engines parse content correctly

Small, deliberate decisions in structure and metadata make your portfolio discoverable and recruiter-friendly. Keep it lean and focused on results.
