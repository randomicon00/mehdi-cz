A concise project case study turns your work into hireable evidence.

Recruiters and prospective clients skim — tell them what matters first: the problem, your role, and the measurable outcome.

### Why case studies matter

- They show impact, not just effort.
- They prove you can solve real business problems.
- They give talking points for interviews and proposals.

### Quick template (copy-paste)

```md
- Problem: One-sentence description of the user/business pain.
- Role: Your responsibilities and level of ownership.
- Solution: 2–4 bullets: tech choices + approach.
- Impact: One or two metrics (before → after, timeframe).
- Link: Live demo / repo
- Takeaway: 1-line lesson learned
```

### Example

- Problem: Slow checkout causing 18% cart abandonment.
- Role: Frontend lead — performance optimizations.
- Solution: Lazy-loaded images, code-split checkout bundle, server-side caching.
- Impact: 40% faster checkout, 9% uplift in conversions (30 days).
- Link: /projects/checkout-performance
- Takeaway: Small bundle wins compounded across critical user flows.

### Tips for readability

- Put the metric first in headings (e.g., "Reduced load by 65% — checkout case study").
- Use a single screenshot (before/after) with captions.
- Keep each case study to one screen of reading if possible.

Write case studies that answer "did you move the needle?" — that gets attention fast.
