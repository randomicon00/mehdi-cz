summary: "Catch common accessibility issues early and at scale; let AI suggest fixes and improve semantics."

Automate a11y checks in CI and use AI to propose fixes and better semantics.

## Playwright + axe-core quickstart

```ts
// tests/a11y.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import AxeBuilder from "@axe-core/playwright";

test("homepage is accessible", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");
  const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
  expect(results.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

## AI remediation hint (pseudo)

```python
def suggest_fix(violation):
    prompt = f"""Suggest minimal HTML change to fix a11y violation:\n{violation}\nReturn: code diff and explanation."""
    return chat([{"role":"user","content":prompt}])
```

## Why this matters

- Accessibility is a quality and compliance requirement.
- Automation catches regressions without heroics.

## How to use this today

- Run axe-core in CI on critical flows.
- Add AI hints to PR comments for faster fixes.

## Common pitfalls

- Treating automation as sufficient; keep manual and user testing.
- Ignoring color contrast and keyboard nav in dynamic states.

## What to try next

- Add screenshots to prompts for better suggestions.
- Track a11y score per route over time in dashboards.
