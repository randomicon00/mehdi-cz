Recruiters check GitHub for evidence of your technical output. Make your profile intentional.

### Quick checklist

- **Profile README**: short intro, top projects, contact info (email/link)
- **Pinned repos**: 3–6 with demos and case studies
- **Repo README**: problem, solution, quickstart, screenshots, license
- **Issues/PRs**: clear commits and collaborative behaviour
- **Activity**: consistent contributions show momentum
