Good prompts are the foundation of effective AI assistance. Structure your requests clearly and provide context.

## Basic Structure

```
Context + Task + Constraints + Format
```

## Examples

**Bad:** "Fix this code"

**Good:**

```
I have a React component that's not updating state correctly.
Please review this useState hook and fix the issue.
Keep the existing prop interface and add TypeScript types.

[code here]
```

## Tips

- Be specific about what you want
- Include relevant context (language, framework, constraints)
- Ask for explanations when learning
- Iterate: refine prompts based on results

**Pro tip:** Save effective prompt templates for common tasks like code reviews, debugging, and architecture discussions.

## Why this matters

- Clear prompts save cycles. You’ll get fewer rewrites and better outputs.
- Good structure turns AI into a reliable collaborator.
- Teams align when prompts capture intent, constraints, and success criteria.

## How to use this today

- Write prompts like tickets: context, goal, constraints, examples.
- Ask for self-checks: “list 3 risks and how you mitigated them.”
- Keep a prompt library; review and iterate like code.

## Common pitfalls

- Vague goals: specify inputs/outputs, formats, and boundaries.
- Hidden assumptions: ask AI to state what it assumed.
- Monolithic asks: chunk into steps; review after each.

## What to try next

- Add evaluation harnesses to score outputs automatically.
- Create role prompts tailored to your domain (SRE, PM, Sec).
- Document reusable patterns with before/after examples.
