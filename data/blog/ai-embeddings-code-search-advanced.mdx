summary: "Combine lexical + semantic search, context windows, and reranking for high-precision code navigation."

Go beyond grep: augment with embeddings and structure awareness.

## Hybrid search sketch

```python
lex = ripgrep("payment.*timeout", repo)
sem = vector_search("retry logic on payment timeouts", top_k=50)
candidates = merge_dedupe(lex, sem)
ranked = cross_encode(query, candidates)
return top(ranked, 20)
```

## Why this matters

- Cuts investigation time and improves PR quality.

## How to use this today

- Index symbols + docs, not just files.
- Cache chunks per commit SHA for stability.

## Common pitfalls

- Overlong chunks; trim to method/class boundaries.

## What to try next

- Add embeddings for AST nodes and tests.
- Fine-tune reranker on your repo clicks.
