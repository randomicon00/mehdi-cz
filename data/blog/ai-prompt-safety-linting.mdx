Treat prompts like code and lint them before merge.

## CI lint job (pseudo)

```yaml
jobs:
  prompt-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npx prompt-lint ./prompts/**/*.md --fail-on risk>medium
```

## Why this matters

- Prevents risky behavior before it reaches production users.

## How to use this today

- Define policies: allowed tools, data classes, refusal rules.
- Store prompts in version control and test them.

## Common pitfalls

- Relying on vendor defaults; codify your own rules.

## What to try next

- Add adversarial tests and red-team suites.
- Track prompt drift over time.
