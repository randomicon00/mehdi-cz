summary: "Use AI to draft translations, enforce terminology, and keep localization in lockstep with code."

Localization lags features. Tighten the loop with AI-assisted drafts and term checks.

## i18next extraction + AI draft

```bash
# extract keys
pnpm i18next 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}' --output locales/$LOCALE/$NAMESPACE.json
```

```ts
// scripts/ai-translate.ts
const keys = Object.entries(require("./locales/en/common.json"));
// call LLM with style guide and glossary to draft target locale
```

## Why this matters

- Ship globally without long waits.
- Keep tone and terminology consistent.

## How to use this today

- Maintain a glossary + style guide; feed them to your LLM.
- Gate AI drafts behind human review in high-risk surfaces.
- Track coverage per-locale in CI to fail if keys drift.

## Common pitfalls

- Blind auto-merge of translations; always review.
- Ignoring gender/locale nuance; add locale-specific policies.
- Out-of-date glossaries; version them alongside code.

## What to try next

- Add screenshot-based context for translators.
- Run linguistic QA on top search and checkout flows.
- Nudge string design to be more localizable upfront.
