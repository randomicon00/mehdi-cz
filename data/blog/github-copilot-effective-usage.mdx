summary: "Maximize GitHub Copilot's potential with smart usage patterns and keyboard shortcuts."

GitHub Copilot works best when you provide clear context and use it as a coding partner, not just an autocomplete tool.

## Key Shortcuts (VS Code)

```
Tab - Accept suggestion
Ctrl+→ - Accept word
Ctrl+] - Next suggestion
Ctrl+[ - Previous suggestion
Ctrl+Enter - Open suggestions panel
```

## Effective Usage Patterns

**Write clear comments first:**

```js
// Create a debounced search function that waits 300ms
// and cancels previous requests
const debouncedSearch =
```

**Use descriptive function names:**

```js
function validateEmailAndSendWelcomeEmail(email) {
  // Copilot will suggest the implementation
}
```

## Pro Tips

- Write tests first - Copilot excels at implementing to match test cases
- Use it for boilerplate generation (configs, schemas, types)
- Leverage it for code translation between languages
- Review all suggestions - don't blindly accept

## Why this matters

- Copilot accelerates flow, but intent and review are still yours.
- Small, clear prompts produce code you can own.
- You’ll spend more time designing, less time typing.

## How to use this today

- Write a comment with goal, types, and edge cases; accept selectively.
- Use ghost text as a suggestion, not a contract—edit freely.
- Compare multiple completions and pick the simplest.

## Common pitfalls

- Paste-driven development: verify APIs and error handling.
- Hidden complexity: ask Copilot to explain its suggestion.
- Ignoring tests: generate tests first for tricky pieces.

## What to try next

- Create repo-level prompt snippets for common patterns.
- Track acceptance vs edit rates to tune your prompting.
- Use Copilot in PRs to propose smaller, clearer diffs.
