summary: Learn how to work with React component props in TypeScript using the ComponentProps utility to streamline prop handling, even when the prop type isn't exported.
---

When building React components in TypeScript, dealing with component props is a common task. But what happens when the prop type of a component isn't exported? Fortunately, TypeScript provides a handy utility called `ComponentProps` that simplifies prop handling without the need to manually define or export prop types. This utility can be a game-changer when you're working with components whose props aren’t explicitly defined or exported.

### The Scenario

Let’s say you have a React component, but the prop types are not exported. Here’s a typical situation:

```tsx
Copy code
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

type Props = {};
```

At this point, you might need to define or reuse the prop types of `MyComponent`. Instead of manually recreating the prop types, you can use TypeScript's `ComponentProps` utility to automatically infer the types.

### Using ComponentProps

TypeScript's `ComponentProps` allows you to extract the props of a given component. Here's how you can use it:

```tsx
import type { ComponentProps } from "react";
import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";

type Props = ComponentProps<typeof MyComponent>;
```

This type will now hold the same structure as `MyComponent`'s props. It's a powerful way to reuse prop definitions across different components without having to manually export or redefine them.

### The Single-Liner

For those who prefer concise code, here's the same solution in a single line:

```tsx
type Props = React.ComponentProps<typeof MyComponent>;
```

With this, you can access all the props of `MyComponent` without having to explicitly define or export them, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

### Why Use `ComponentProps`?

1. **DRY Principle**: Don’t repeat yourself! Avoid redefining prop types that already exist.
2. **Type Safety**: By inferring the types directly from the component, you ensure type safety and consistency across your application.
3. **Maintainability**: If `MyComponent`'s prop types change, the `ComponentProps` type will automatically update, reducing the chance of mismatched types.
