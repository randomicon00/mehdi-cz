title: "Subshells vs grouping"

draft: false
summary: "Use ( ) for subshells and { } for grouping commands in the current shell."

```bash
(cd /tmp; ls)    # runs in subshell, cwd unchanged
{ cd /tmp; ls; } # runs in current shell
```

Tip: variable changes in subshells do not affect the parent shell.
