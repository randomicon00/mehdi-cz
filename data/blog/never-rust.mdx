summary: Rust's `!` type is equivalent to TypeScript's `never`, used to represent functions or expressions that never return a value.
---

In Rust, the equivalent of the `never` type in TypeScript is the `!` type (pronounced "never type"). It represents values that never occur and is used in functions or expressions that do not return.

## Key Uses of `!` in Rust:

1. **Functions That Never Return**: Functions that either run indefinitely (e.g., infinite loops) or always panic/abort can have the return type `!`. This tells the Rust compiler that the function will never successfully return a value.

#### Example 1: Infinite Loop

```rust
fn infinite_loop() -> ! {
    loop {
        // This loop will never end, so the return type is `!`
    }
}
```

#### Example 2: Panicking Functions

```rust
fn panic_example() -> ! {
    panic!("This function will never return.");
}
```

#### Example 3: Match Exhaustiveness

The `!` type can also be used in patterns where some branches are unreachable. For instance, when matching on an enum where some variants are impossible, the compiler can infer `!` for those branches.

```rust
fn match_exhaustiveness(value: Result<i32, &str>) {
    match value {
        Ok(num) => println!("Number: {}", num),
        Err(err) => println!("Error: {}", err),
        _ => unreachable!(), // This branch returns `!`
    }
}
```

### Summary:

The `!` type in Rust is used to indicate that a function or expression `never` returns. It is typically used in functions that panic, run infinitely, or mark unreachable code paths. Just like TypeScript's `never`, Rust's `!` type helps the compiler and the programmer understand that certain code paths will never produce a value.
