Flaky tests slow teams. Detect them early, suppress the pain, and fix fast.

## Quick quarantine

```yaml
# jest.config.js (example)
testRetry: 2
```

```bash
# mark known flakies
echo 'flaky: /checkout.test.ts' >> .ci/flaky.txt
```

## AI hinting (pseudo)

```bash
# scripts/ai-flaky-hints.sh
git log -n 50 --name-only | grep test | node scripts/llm-hints.mjs
```

## Why this matters

- Keeps CI green and trustworthy.
- Focuses engineering effort on high-impact fixes.

## How to use this today

- Track failures per-test and auto-quarantine above a threshold.
- Generate a weekly report with suspected causes and owners.
- Add deterministic waits and network fakes to stabilize.

## Common pitfalls

- Hiding flakies forever; add expiry on quarantines.
- Overreliance on retries; treat as a stopgap, not a fix.
- Missing env parity; containerize the test runtime.

## What to try next

- Cluster failures by error message and code area to reduce noise.
- Auto-open issues with minimal repro steps.
- Add synthetic tests for critical paths to complement E2E.
