Unify signals with OpenTelemetry and layer AI for correlation and anomaly detection.

## OTEL collector with simple anomaly hook (pseudo)

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols: { grpc: {}, http: {} }
exporters:
  loki: { endpoint: http://loki:3100 }
  tempo: { endpoint: http://tempo:3200 }
  prometheusremotewrite: { endpoint: http://mimir:9009/api/v1/push }
processors:
  batch: {}
  attributes: { actions: [{ key: service.name, action: upsert, value: myapp }] }
  ai_anomaly: { model: small, sensitivity: medium }
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      { receivers: [otlp], processors: [batch, ai_anomaly], exporters: [prometheusremotewrite] }
    logs: { receivers: [otlp], processors: [batch, ai_anomaly], exporters: [loki] }
    traces: { receivers: [otlp], processors: [batch, ai_anomaly], exporters: [tempo] }
```

## Why this matters

- Faster triage by correlating signals automatically.
- Reduces alert fatigue with context-rich incidents.

## How to use this today

- Start with Grafana stack (Loki/Tempo/Mimir) or OpenObserve.
- Add ML-based detectors for high-cardinality metrics and logs.
- Feed incidents to ChatOps with AI summaries and likely root-cause.

## Common pitfalls

- Black-box models; keep heuristics + ML side-by-side.
- Cost blowups; sample and downsample high-volume signals.

## What to try next

- Train service-specific anomaly models on your golden signals.
- Implement auto-runbooks gated by SLO error budgets.
