If AI for coding feels confusing, this guide is for you. We’ll keep it calm and simple, so you can get real value without stress.

## What you’ll learn

- Where AI helps in real projects (and where it doesn’t)
- How to ask for help in a clear way
- How to stay safe and in control

## Where AI shines

- Explaining code you don’t know
- Writing small helpers or boilerplate
- Turning ideas into drafts (tests, docs, comments)

## Where AI struggles

- Vague goals and missing context
- Big rewrites in one go
- Hidden business rules or risky changes

## A simple way to start

1. Pick a tiny task (e.g., “add a loading state”).
2. Share the context: file, framework, constraints.
3. Ask for a short draft and a quick checklist.
4. Review like a teammate wrote it. Test. Commit.

## Tips for good results

- Be specific: what, where, why. Short is fine.
- Ask for options, not magic. Compare and pick.
- Keep humans in the loop for decisions.

## Common mistakes

- Asking for “the best way” without any context
- Copying answers blindly
- Skipping tests and code review

## Key takeaways

- Start small. Keep control. Iterate.
- AI is great for drafts and speed, not for final judgment.
- Clear prompts and careful reviews win every time.

## FAQ

- Is AI replacing developers? No. It’s a tool. You lead, it helps.
- Do I need to learn a new framework? No. Use it inside your current workflow.
- What about privacy? Don’t paste secrets. Follow your company policy.
