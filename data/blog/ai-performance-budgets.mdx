Codify budgets and have AI suggest diffs when you exceed them.

## Lighthouse CI + AI hint (pseudo)

```yaml
assert: { performance: ">=0.9", first-contentful-paint: "<=1800" }
onFail: aiSuggestFix: true
```

## Why this matters

- Users bounce on slow apps; speed is compounding.

## How to use this today

- Track budgets in CI and block risky merges.
- Ask AI to propose code-split, image, and cache fixes.

## Common pitfalls

- Measuring on ideal hardware only; add mobile profiles.

## What to try next

- Tie flags to performance guardrails.
- Add RUM to validate real-world impact.
