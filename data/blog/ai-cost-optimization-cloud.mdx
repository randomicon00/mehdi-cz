Use AI to find waste and enforce cost-aware defaults.

## K8s rightsizing hint (pseudo)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourcePolicy
metadata: { name: web }
spec:
  container: web
  ai_recommendation: { cpu: 200m, memory: 256Mi }
```

## Why this matters

- Cost is a reliability constraint; waste impacts margins.

## How to use this today

- Start with tagging and per-team cost dashboards.
- Add AI anomaly alerts for sudden spikes and zombie resources.

## Common pitfalls

- Optimizing pennies while ignoring biggest drivers.
- No accountability; assign owners per cost center.

## What to try next

- Use usage-based tests in CI to prevent regressions.
- Tie feature flags to budget guardrails.
