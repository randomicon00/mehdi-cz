Bugs happen. With a simple method, AI can help you find the cause faster and propose a safe fix.

## A calm method

1. Describe the bug in one sentence (what you see, what you expected).
2. Share the smallest code and inputs that reproduce it.
3. Ask: “List 3 likely causes and 3 quick checks.”
4. Try one check, report the result, repeat.

## Helpful prompts

- “Explain the error message like I’m a teammate. What does it mean in this file?”
- “Suggest a minimal change that fixes this and why.”
- “What tests should I add to avoid this in future?”

## Keep control

- Change one thing at a time
- Keep diffs small and reversible
- Add a test that fails first, then passes

## Common pitfalls

- Sharing too much context at once
- Accepting big refactors during a fix
- Skipping the repro step

## Takeaways

- Clear reproduction is power
- AI gives options; you choose the safe path
- Always leave a test behind
