Cloud cost surprises hurt. Catch anomalies and fix them at the source.

## Daily anomaly check (pseudo)

```bash
fetch_costs --yesterday | llm --prompt "Flag anomalies >20% and suggest root causes"
```

## Guardrails (example)

```yaml
policies:
  - name: deny-untagged
    rule: resource.tags.env is null
    action: reject
  - name: spot-budget
    rule: spend.spot_pct > 70
    action: require-approval
```

## Why this matters

- Avoids bill shock and waste.
- Encourages better engineering habits.

## How to use this today

- Label everything; no tags, no deploy.
- Track unit costs (per-request, per-tenant) not just totals.
- Tie alerts to owners with runbooks.

## Common pitfalls

- Only looking monthly; add daily checks.
- Alert fatigue; threshold with context.
- Fixing symptoms; add budgets and limits per team.

## What to try next

- Predict next-week spend and compare to budgets.
- Automate rightsizing suggestions on idle resources.
- Show per-feature margins to drive roadmap decisions.
