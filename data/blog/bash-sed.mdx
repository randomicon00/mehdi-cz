summary: "sed performs text transforms in a stream; safe inline edits with backups."
---

Replace text (inline with backup):

```bash
sed -i.bak 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

Use `-r` or `-E` for extended regex and `sed -n` to suppress default printing.

Tip: `ed`/`ex` can be easier for scripted in-place edits on macOS where sed differs.
