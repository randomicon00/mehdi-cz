Recruiters and clients scan for impact first. Metrics provide credibility and quick decision signals.

### Which metrics to show

- **Business**: conversion, revenue, retention
- **Technical**: load time, TTI, error rate
- **Operational**: deploy frequency, MTTR (mean time to recover)

### How to present metrics

- Use before → after format and timeframe
- Prefer absolute numbers alongside percentages
- Add context: baseline and why it matters

### Examples

- "Reduced homepage load from 3.4s to 1.2s (–65%), increasing conversions by 9% in 30 days."
- "Cut error rate from 2.4% to 0.2% leading to 12% fewer support tickets per month."

### Quick badge template (for project headers)

```text
Performance: 65% faster (3.4s → 1.2s) • Conversion: +9% (30 days)
```

Metrics tell a story — always add a one-line business outcome to make the impact clear.
