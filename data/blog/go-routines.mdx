# Go Routines: Built-in Concurrency

Go provides **goroutines**, a built-in concurrency mechanism that allows developers to run functions asynchronously without needing external libraries. Goroutines are lightweight and managed by the Go runtime, which efficiently schedules them across available CPU cores.

1. **Concurrency Made Easy**: By using the `go` keyword before a function call, Go allows that function to run concurrently. Goroutines are cheaper in terms of memory and CPU usage than traditional threads.

2. **Channels for Communication**: Go also includes **channels**, which enable safe communication between goroutines. Channels are type-safe and allow developers to pass data between goroutines, avoiding race conditions and making concurrency simpler.

3. **Efficient Scheduling**: The Go runtime automatically manages goroutines, ensuring they are scheduled efficiently on multiple cores without manual intervention.

Goroutines make asynchronous programming in Go easy, providing built-in concurrency without the need for complex setup or external dependencies.
