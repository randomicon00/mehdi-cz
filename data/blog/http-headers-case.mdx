summary: A quick tip for web developers on the case insensitivity of HTML headers, a little-known but useful quirk in HTML standards that simplifies development.

Today I learned that HTTP header keys are **case-insensitive!** This means headers like `Content-Type` and `content-type` are treated the same way. While HTTP allows this flexibility, using lowercase consistently (like `content-type`) is a best practice. It keeps code predictable, readable, and works well with frameworks that default to lowercase.

Here's a quick example:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.example.com
curl -H "content-type: application/json" https://api.example.com
```

Both commands send the same `Content-Type` header, no matter the case.
