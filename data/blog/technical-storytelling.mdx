Technical skills are necessary; storytelling makes them persuasive. Short, structured narratives help recruiters remember you.

### Simple narrative arc (for case studies)

- **Hook**: one-sentence problem or statistic
- **Stakes**: why it mattered (users, business)
- **Action**: what you did and major trade-offs
- **Result**: metric and lesson learned

### Example opener

"Checkout was failing 18% of the time during peak hours—customers left. I led a performance overhaul that cut failures to 1.5% and recovered $40k/month in revenue."

### Visuals and architecture

- Use a single diagram to show the system before/after
- Annotate decisions with bullets: tradeoff, cost, upside

### SEO tip for storytelling posts

- Put the metric and technology in the title: e.g., "Reduced checkout failures 18% → 1.5% — Next.js performance case study"

Short, structured stories turn technical details into memorable, hireable evidence.
