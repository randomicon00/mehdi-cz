summary: "Automate code reviews using AI to catch bugs, suggest improvements, and ensure code quality."
---

Implement AI-powered code review in your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early and maintain code quality standards.

## GitHub Actions AI Code Review

```yaml
name: AI Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: AI Code Review
        uses: ./ai-review-action
        with:
          openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          files_changed: ${{ github.event.pull_request.changed_files }}
```

## Python Review Script

```python
import openai
import subprocess
import json

def get_diff():
    result = subprocess.run(['git', 'diff', 'HEAD~1'],
                          capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout

def review_code(diff):
    prompt = f"""
    Review this code diff for:
    - Bugs and potential issues
    - Performance problems
    - Security vulnerabilities
    - Code style and best practices

    Diff:
    {diff}

    Provide specific, actionable feedback.
    """

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Manual review
python code_reviewer.py --file src/auth.py

# PR integration
python code_reviewer.py --pr-diff > review_comments.md
```

**Tip:** Combine with static analysis tools like ESLint, SonarQube for comprehensive code quality checks.

## Why this matters

- Consistent reviews raise the floor and free humans for higher-level feedback.
- You’ll catch risky patterns early (security, perf, reliability).
- Review load drops because small fixes get automated.

## How to use this today

- Treat the bot like a junior reviewer: opinions, but humans decide.
- Calibrate on one repo; tune rules from noisy to useful.
- Auto-fix trivial nits; escalate only high-signal findings.

## Common pitfalls

- Rule creep: keep the rule set small and outcome-driven.
- False confidence: critical changes still need deep human review.
- Context loss: require reproduction steps for non-trivial findings.

## What to try next

- Add risk scoring and require senior reviewers above a threshold.
- Generate release notes from merged PR descriptions.
- Track review cycle time and quality metrics in a dashboard.
