Code review can be slow. AI can help you focus on what matters, while you keep the final say.

## How AI helps reviews

- Summarizes changes in simple words
- Highlights risky parts (security, perf, broken tests)
- Suggests small fixes or better names

## A simple workflow

1. Ask for a high-level summary: “What changed and why might it matter?”
2. Ask for 3 risks and 3 test ideas.
3. Ask for 1–2 small improvements you can do now.
4. You decide. You own the review.

## Example prompts (no secrets)

- “Summarize this diff. Point out risky areas for security or performance.”
- “Suggest test cases for the new function. Keep it short.”
- “Propose clearer names for these variables.”

## Keep it respectful

- Use AI to help, not to shame.
- Praise what’s good. Ask questions where unsure.
- Be specific: one concrete suggestion beats vague comments.

## Common pitfalls

- Letting AI approve PRs. Don’t.
- Overloading comments. Focus on impact.
- Blindly trusting suggestions. Run tests.

## Key takeaways

- AI makes review faster and calmer.
- You own the judgment and the merge.
- Keep it human: clear, kind, and constructive.
