summary: "Build a docs assistant that cites sources, asks clarifying questions, and escalates gracefully."

Make support bots useful: cite, clarify, and handoff.

## Clarifying question pattern

```python
if confidence < 0.6 or missing_required_params(q):
  return ask("To answer, I need version and environment. Which applies?")
```

## Why this matters

- Boosts self-serve and reduces ticket volume.

## How to use this today

- Ground on latest docs, release notes, and API specs.
- Instrument satisfaction and escalate to humans with context.

## Common pitfalls

- Hallucinations without citations; always include source links.

## What to try next

- Personalize answers with account metadata (privacy-aware).
- Add quickfix PRs for docs when gaps are detected.
