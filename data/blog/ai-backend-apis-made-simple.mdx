summary: "Design and maintain APIs with AI help, but keep them boring and reliable."
---

Good APIs are boring: predictable names, clean responses, nice errors.

## Ask AI for structure, not magic

- “Propose clear resource names and routes for this feature.”
- “Suggest error shapes and status codes.”
- “Write 3 contract tests I can run in CI.”

## Design tips

- Consistent naming
- Paginate early
- Useful error messages with ids

## Safety

- Don’t include secrets in prompts
- Validate inputs server-side
- Log errors without leaking PII

## Pitfalls

- Over-custom formats per endpoint
- Versioning only after breaking changes
- Mixing business logic into controllers

## Takeaways

- Keep APIs simple and honest
- AI speeds drafts; you own the contract
- Tests and logs tell the truth
