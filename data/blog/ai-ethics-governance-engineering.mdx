Move beyond vibes: implement concrete guardrails engineers can run.

## Preflight checklist (excerpt)

```md
- Purpose and scope documented
- Data sources, consent, retention reviewed
- Bias and harm analysis completed
- Red-teaming scenario tested
- Human-in-the-loop decision points identified
- Observability, rollback, and user feedback wired
```

## Why this matters

- Small process now avoids big regulatory and brand risks later.

## How to use this today

- Add a CODEOWNERS + checklist for AI changes in PR templates.
- Store model cards and data sheets alongside code.

## Common pitfalls

- Treating governance as a one-time doc; keep it living in repo.
- No escalation path; assign owners and SLAs.

## What to try next

- Automate checks (PII scanners, prompt risk linting) in CI.
- Add user-facing transparency notes and opt-outs.
