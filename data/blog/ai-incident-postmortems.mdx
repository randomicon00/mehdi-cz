Let AI assemble timelines, impact summaries, and candidate actions from tickets, alerts, and PRs.

## Draft postmortem with structured prompts

```python
from datetime import datetime

def draft_postmortem(incident):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an SRE postmortem assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"""
Summarize this incident:
- Title: {incident.title}
- Start: {incident.start}
- End: {incident.end}
- Timeline entries: {incident.timeline}
- Alerts: {incident.alerts}
- Commits/PRs: {incident.changes}
Produce: Summary, Impact, Root Cause (hypothesis), Timeline, Action Items (SMART), Owners.
"""}
    ]
    return chat(messages)
```

## Why this matters

- Speeds up learning loops and consistency.
- Frees engineers from copy/paste to focus on analysis.

## How to use this today

- Pull data from PagerDuty, GitHub, Jira; normalize into a timeline.
- Gate AI drafts with a clear review/approval step.

## Common pitfalls

- Missing context; ensure all systems feed into the timeline.
- Blame-y language; enforce blameless templates in prompts.

## What to try next

- Trend actions across incidents to identify systemic fixes.
- Link actions to roadmaps and track completion SLAs.
