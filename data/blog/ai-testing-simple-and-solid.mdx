title: "AI for Testing: Keep It Simple and Solid"
date: "2025-09-17"
tags: ["ai", "testing", "qa"]
draft: false
summary: "Create small, clear tests with AI. Focus on behavior, not noise."
---

Tests protect your work. AI can write drafts fast, but you decide what’s worth keeping.

## Good tests are small

- One behavior per test
- Clear arrange/act/assert
- No hidden magic or random sleeps

## What to ask AI

- “Write 3 tests for these edge cases. Keep them short.”
- “Convert this flaky test into a stable version.”
- “Suggest realistic data and boundary values.”

## Don’t overdo it

- Many tiny tests > one giant test
- Favor fast unit tests; add a few E2E for happy path
- Delete tests that only duplicate other tests

## Common mistakes

- Letting AI generate hundreds of tests you won’t maintain
- Skipping assertions that matter
- Testing implementation details instead of behavior

## Key takeaways

- Use AI for test ideas and first drafts
- You pick the final set, you own the quality
- Keep tests clear, fast, and meaningful
